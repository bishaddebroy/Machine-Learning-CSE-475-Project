Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms

Abstract— This paper helps in predicting diabetes by
applying machine learning technique. Thus, the most
important issue is the prediction to be very accurate and
to use a reliable method for that. Three different
machine learning algorithms are used in this research
work. For experiment purpose, a dataset of patient's
medical record is obtained and three different machine
learning algorithms are applied on the dataset.
Performance and accuracy of the applied algorithms is
discussed and compared. Comparison of the different
machine learning techniques used in this study reveals
which algorithm is best suited for prediction of diabetes.
The results show that the machine learning algorithms
can able to produce highly accurate diabetes predictive
healthcare systems.
Keywords— Machine learning algorithms, Diabetes
prediction, Neural network, Logistic regression,
Prediction, Data classification.
